The **AutoRest** tool generates client libraries for accessing RESTful web services. Input to *AutoRest* is a spec that describes the REST API using the [Swagger](http://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) format. 

##Getting AutoRest##
AutoRest is shipped as part of Visual Studio 2015 web tools.

Alternatively it can be installed from [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) by running:

    choco install autorest

##Hello World##
For this version  of Hello World, we will use **AutoRest** to generate a client library and use it to call a web service. The trivial web service that just returns a string is defined as follows: 
```
public class HelloWorldController : ApiController
{
    // GET: api/HelloWorld
    public string Get()
    {
        return "Hello via AutoRest.";
    }
}
```
By convention, Swagger documents are exposed by web services with the name `swagger.json`.  The `title` property of the `info` object is used by **AutoRest**  as the name of the client object in the generated library. The `host` + `path` of the operation corresponds to the URL of the operation endpoint. The `operationId` is used as the method name. The spec declares that a `GET` request will return an HTTP 200 status code with content of mime-type `application/json` and the body will be a string. For a more in-depth overview of swagger parsing refer to [working with swagger](Documentation\swagger.md) section of the [documentation](Documentation).

```
{
  "swagger": "2.0",
  "info": {
    "title": "MyClient",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "host": "swaggersample.azurewebsites.net",
  "paths": {
    "/api/HelloWorld": {
      "get": {
        "operationId": "GetGreeting",
        "produces": [
          "application/json"
        ],
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "GETs a greeting.",
            "schema": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Next, we invoke **AutoRest.exe** with this swagger document to generate client library code (see [command line interface documentation](Documentation/cli.md) for details). 

**AutoRest** is extensible and can support multiple types of input and output. *AutoRest.exe* comes with the *AutoRest.json* configuration file that defines the available inputs (*Modelers*) and outputs (*CodeGenerators*). When invoking *AutoRest.exe*, you must specify the `-Modeler` and `-CodeGenerator` to use.

The Swagger schema is language agnostic and doesn't include the notion of namespace, but for generating code, AutoRest requires `-BaseNamespace` be specified.  By default, the CodeGenerator will place output in a directory named *Generated*. This can be overridden by providing the `-OutputFolder` parameter.

>AutoRest.exe -CodeGenerator CSharp -Modeler Swagger -Input swagger.json -BaseNamespace MyNamespace

Now, we will use the generated code to call the web serviced.

Create a console application called *HelloWorld*. Add the generated files to it. They won't compile until you add the NuGet package the generated code depends on: `Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime`.

You can add it to the Visual Studio project using the NuGet package manager or in the Package Manager Console with this command:
> Install-Package Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime

Add the namespace that was given to AutoRest.
```
using MyNamespace;
```
We now access the REST API with the fact that `GetGreeting` will throw an exception if the response is not a 200 OK, we can access the REST API with very little code (see [using generated clients](Documentation/using-clients.md) for details).
```
var myClient = new MyClient();
var salutation = myClient.GetGreeting();
Console.WriteLine(salutation);
```
Running the console app shows the greeting retrieved from the service API.
>C:\\>HelloWorld.exe
>Hello via AutoRest.

With that same basic pattern in place, you can now explore how different REST API operations and payloads are described in Swagger and exposed in the code generated by **AutoRest**.
