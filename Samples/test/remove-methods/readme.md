# Remove certain methods from the pipeline

``` yaml 
input-file: remove-methods.yaml
csharp: true
clear-output-folder: true
batch:
  - 
    # Regular run
    output-folder: Client
  - 
    # Hide method
    output-folder: ClientFancy
    # add the following directive to your configuration to hide operation `Cowbell_Add`
    directive:
      - from: swagger-document
        where: $.paths.*[?(@.operationId == "Cowbell_Add")]
        transform: return undefined
    # for demonstration purposes, also emit a Swagger file that represents the original Swagger minus the removed operation
    output-artifact: swagger-document.yaml
```

The directive finds method `Cowbell_Add` and removes the corresponding object graph from the Swagger representation.

## Summary

Add a `directive` as follows in order to remove an operation with operation ID `<OPERATION_ID>`:
``` yaml false
from: swagger-document
where: $.paths.*[?(@.operationId == "<OPERATION_ID>")]
transform: return undefined
```
