# Implementation Notes:
 - AutoRest should have a stream-based preprocess mode
 - Should also have a file-watcher mode. (ie, watch a file/files for chagnes and preprocess to another set of files)
 - is there a standard for a map-file generation that we should know about?
 - `AutoRest help <readme.md>` should generate useful help that will spit out options that can be specified.
