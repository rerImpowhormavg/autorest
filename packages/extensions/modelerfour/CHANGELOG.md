- **Fix** Issue with sibling models(Model just being a ref of another) causing circular dependency exception. ([PR 375](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.modelerfour/pull/375))
- **Fix** Issue with duplicates schemas names due to consequtive name duplicate removal. ([PR 374](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.modelerfour/pull/374))
- Schemas with `x-ms-enum`'s `modelAsString` set to `true` will now be represented as `ChoiceSchema` even with a single value.
- `Accept` headers are now automatically added to operations having responses with content types
- Added `always-seal-x-ms-enum` settings to always create `SealedChoiceSchema` when an `x-ms-enum` is encountered

## 4.14.x

### Patches

- added `exception` SchemaContext for `usage` when used as an exception response
- changed `output` SchemaContext for `usage` to no longer include exception response uses

## 4.13.x

### Patches

- add security info (checks to see if `input.components?.securitySchemes` has any content)
- sync version of m4 and perks/codemodel == 4.13.x
- adding quality prechecker step as a way to test the OAI document for quality before modelerfour runs.
- report duplicate parents via allOf as an error.
- added `modelerfour.lenient-model-deduplication` to cause schemas with duplicated names to be renamed with an `AutoGenerated` suffix.  Note that this is a *temporary* measuer that should only be used when Swaggers cannot be updated easily.  This option will be removed in a future version of Modeler Four.

## 4.12.x

### Patches

- updated CI to build packages
- any is in a category in schemas
- times is a new category in schemas (not populated yet, next build)
- polymorphic payloads are not flattened (when it's the class that declares the discriminator)
- readonly is pulled from the schema if it's there
- body parameters should have the required flag set correctly
- content-type is now a header parameter (wasn't set before)
- added `modelerfour.always-create-content-type-parameter` to always get the content type parameter even when there are only one option.
- add support for x-ms-api-version extension to force enabling/disabling parameter to be treated as an api-version parameter
- the checker plugin will now halt on errors (can be disabled by `modelerfour.additional-checks: false`)
- when an enum without type is presented, if the values are all strings, assume 'string'
- flatten parents first for consistency
- added choiceType for content-type schema

## 4.6.x

### Patches

- add additional checks for empty names, collisions
- fix errant processing on APString => Apstring 
- x-ms-client-name fixes on parameters
- added setting for `preserve-uppercase-max-length` to preserve uppercase words up to a certain length.

## 4.5.x

### Patches

- static linking libraries for stability
- processed all names in namer, styles can be set in config (see below):
- support overrides in namer 
- static linked dependency

## 4.4.x

### Patches

- parameter grouping 
- some namer changes 

## 4.3.x

### Patches

- flattening (model and payload) enabled.
- properties should respect x-ms-client-name (many fixes)
- global parameters should try to be in order of original spec
- filter out 'x-ms-original' from extensions
- add serializedName for host parameters
- make sure reused global parameter is added to method too
- processed values in constants/enums a bit better, support AnySchema for no type/format 
- support server variable parameters as method unless they have x-ms-parameter-location

## 4.2.75

### Patches

- add `style` to parameters to support collection format 
- `potential-breaking-change` Include common paramters from oai/path #68 (requires fix from autorest-core 3.0.6160+ ) 
- propogate extensions from server parameters (ie, x-ms-skip-url-encoding) #61
- `potential-breaking-change` make operation groups case insensitive. #59 
- `potential-breaking-change` sealedChoice/Choice selection was backwards ( was creating a sealedchoice schema for modelAsString:true and vice versa) #62 
- `potential-breaking-change` drop constant schema from response, use constantschema's valueType instead. #63
- `potential-breaking-change` fix body parameter marked as required when not marked so in spec. #64

## 4.1.60

### Patches

- query parameters should have a serializedName so that they don't rely on the cosmetic name property.

## 4.1.58

### Patches

- version bump, change your configuration to specify version `~4.1.0` or greater
  
  ``` 
  use-extension:
    "@autorest/modelerfour" : "~4.1.0" 
  ```
  - each Http operation (via `.protocol.http`) will now have a separate `path` and `uri` properties. 
  <br>Both are still templates, and will have parameters. 
  <br>The parameters for the `uri` property will have `in` set to `ParameterLocation.Uri`
  <br>The parameters for the `path` property will continue to have `in` set to `ParameterLocation.Path`

  
  - autorest-core recently added an option to aggressively deduplicate inline models (ie, ones without a name)
  and modeler-four based generator will have that enabled by default. (ie `deduplicate-inline-models: true`)
  <br>This may increase deduplication time on extremely large openapi models.

  - this package contains the initial code for the flattener plugin, however it is not yet enabled.

  - updated `@azure-tools/codemodel` package to `3.0.241`:
  <br>`uri` (required) was added to `HttpRequest`
  <br>`flattenedNames` (optional) was added to `Property` (in anticipation of supporting flattening)
